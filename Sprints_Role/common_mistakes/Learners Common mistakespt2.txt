Mr.Mahmoud, You put a lot of effort into this task, and it shows. Thank you for your commitment
Regarding the API "Receive Signal" this API is in the COMM module and the RTE use it to ask the Communication stack to reply with the received Data on the Bus. 
so you can consider it as an invocation form the RTE side to the COMM module so the COMM module will reply with a pointer to the received Data {Stored in the COMM buffer}



Mohamed Yassin :

Great Job Mr.Mohamed specially the reception sequence. please find the blow notes:

Start-up sequence : please submit a start-up sequence because it is not atched in this submtion 

Transmation sequence : Every thing looks fine execpt that thir is no Os task to intialize the transmation process => Hint: search for {Com_MainFunctionTx} it should be called bt the OS



Amr Ashraf :

Great Job Mr.Mohamed, please find the blow notes and resubmit the task:

Start-up sequence :

such as the Pdur and CanIf and so on. Then comes the confirmations from those lower layers after the main function context 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Job Mr.Fouad  
Please consider the following notes :

Start-up sequence :
Note(1):
There is an Indication API from the CanSM to the ComM to state that the bus mode after the full initialization 
Hint: search for the function called "ComM_BusSM_ModeIndication"

Note(2): 
Please state the API names used from the CanSm  and The CanIf and also between the Can and the Cantrcv to achieve the full initialization 
Hint: Search for the APIs {CanIf_SetTrcvMode(Normal), CanTrcv_SetOpMode(Normal) ,CanIf_SetControllerMode()}

Note(2):
For each API you call there shall be a confirmation, It is one of the most important standards in the Autosar 


Transformation sequence :
Note(1):
The API {Can_Write()} is triggered from the CanIf SWC to the Can SWC not to the OS Task

Note(2):
The API {Com_MainFunctionTx()} shall be called by the OS to trigger all the lower layer modules with their functions
such as the COMM and Pdur and CanIf and so on inside the context of the Com_MainFunctionTx().
Then comes the confirmations from those lower layers after the main function context 


Reception sequence:
Please, submit a separate  RX sequence


Great Efrots 
Please consider the following notes : 

Start-up sequence :

Note(1): minor
There is an Indication API from the CanSM to the ComM to state that the bus mode after the full initialization 
Hint: search for the function called "ComM_BusSM_ModeIndication"


Transformation sequence :

Note(1): 
As the transmission sequence you are presenting is the pooling type which senses the message b=not by interrupt then,
The API {Com_MainFunctionTx()} shall be called by the OS to trigger all the lower layer modules with their functions
such as the COMM and Pdur and CanIf and so on inside the context of the Com_MainFunctionTx().
Then comes the confirmations from those lower layers after the main function context 


Reception sequence:
Looks great as an interrupt type reception sequence
